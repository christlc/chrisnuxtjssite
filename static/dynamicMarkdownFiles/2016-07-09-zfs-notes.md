This is a set of notes for common ZFS command and operations.

ZFS is an advanced file system that enabled snapshot, checksum and soft-raid features. [Wiki on ZFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS)

A good set of ZFS reference can be found below:
[ZFS admin intro](https://pthree.org/2012/12/04/zfs-administration-part-i-vdevs/)


# Create a ZFS mount

## List all disks

List all paritions:

```bash
lsblk
```

Show details of the disks:

```bash
sudo lshw -class disk
```

## Create a mirrored pool
The follow would create a mirror (think raid 0) across two devices.

```bash
sudo zpool create tank mirror sdd sde
```

# Create a dataset on top of the pool

Instead of directly using the created pool, it is usual to build a
couple of datasets on top of the pool. To create a dataset,

```bash
zfs create tank/test
zfs set compression=lz4 tank/log
zfs set mountpoint=/mnt/test tank/test
zfs mount tank/test
```

We also enable the compression of the dataset via set compression.


# Create a NFS share on top of the created dataset

Setup nfs under Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo aptitude install -R nfs-kernel-server
echo '/mnt localhost(ro)' >> /etc/exports
sudo /etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server start
```


Share nfs:

```bash
zfs set sharenfs="rw=@10.80.86.0/24" pool/srv
zfs set sharenfs="on" pool/srv
```


# Scrub the dataset regularly

Scrubing check the data integrity:
```bash
zpool scrub tank
```

Consider adding above to a cron-job.  A set of script can be found here:
