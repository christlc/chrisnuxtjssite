# Fun with openwrt

Openwrt is an embedded operating system based on the Linux kernel.

I have given a talk on some small projects in HKOSCon 2016:
[Openwrt projects](https://github.com/christlc/open-source-conf-hk2016).

## Today's agenda

1. Choose a suitable device for flashing
2. Flash your router
3. Extend your storage via ExtRoot
3. Install packages using okpg
4. Collect data with WiFi
4. Interface with Arduino via USB serial
5. Modifying the LUCI as frontend
6. Using the buttons on your router
